# voxel-prototype
 
 A simple implementation of voxel terrain in Unity engine.

This project generates and renders voxel terrain. Perlin noise is used to generate a random terrain configuration. Terrain is rendered in chunks that are dynamically loaded and unloaded based on the player's position. This improves performance, allowing the terrain to cover a much larger area.
